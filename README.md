# global-logger
Simple logging utility with log levels - run in global scope.

# motivation
There are quite a few logging packages around - this one tries to be a very simple variant, which doesn't require to be wired throughout the application but uses a FGV instead. It introduces several logging levels to allow for easy control of the depth of logged information.

# usage
All you need is initialize your logger at the start of your application. Then log by specific level wherever in your application. Close the logger afterwards.

This snippet will produce the following in the `application_directory/logs/[year]/[month]/[day]/Demo_log.tsv`:
```
15:21:40.630 23.10.2018 INFO  For loop cycle: 0 Global_logger.lvlib:Example.vi

15:21:40.630 23.10.2018 WARN  Something might go wrong..  Global_logger.lvlib:Example.vi

15:21:40.630 23.10.2018 FATAL ..Ups ! Global_logger.lvlib:Example.vi

```

Additionally you can create multiple named loggers and assign each of them with one to many output destinations (files or UI controls). See Examples.

# features
- Globally accessible logger
- Six logging levels
- Configurable level meaning:
  - Standard: Ignores messages with log level which is less important that the logger's level.
  - Positive: Ignores messages with log level with greater importance that the logger's level.
  - Exact: Ignores messages with all levels except for the exact logger's level.
- Error wire check & error logging
- Configurable record fields:
  - timestamp
  - log level
  - logger name
  - message
  - source VI
  - source app
- Output to file
  - csv, tsv formats
  - year/month/day folder structure
  - configurable file size
  - configurable maximum logs age
- Output to UI controls
  - String, Listbox, Multicolumn Listbox, Table controls
- Option to write to multiple named loggers
  - Multiple outputs (file, UI) per logger each with it's own setup
- Configurable record ordering: new records to top / bottom
- Timestamp formatting

Contribution's welcome!
## ideas for future versions
- more intelligent/efficient Writer.vi - currently each record = 1 write operation
